## Pointers
A pointer is a variable whose value is an address, i.e., the actual value pf a pointer type is an address of memory. While dealing with pointers, the two important operators to be used are:
- & : the address operator
- * : the dereferencing (indirection) operator

Consider the statement: int *ptr = var;
Here, the variable <strong>ptr</strong> is a pointer, which holds the address of the variable <strong>var</strong> as its value.
